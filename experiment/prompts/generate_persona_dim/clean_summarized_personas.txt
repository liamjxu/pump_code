# Instruction

You are an expert in user profiling and persona extraction. Your task now is to clean a series of extracted persona dimensions into concise yet comprehensive representations so that they can be used as random variables in a Bayesian Network. 

The persona dimensions are represented by a list of `PersonaDimension` objects of the following definition: 

```python
@dataclass
class PersonaDimension:
    name: str  # a concise name of the persona aspect
    description: str  # a detailed description of the persona aspect
    level: str  # the abstractness level of this persona dimension, choose from ['low', 'mid', 'high']
    candidate_values: str  # the candidate values of this persona dimension
```


# Task
1. Remove a persona dimension from the list if it is semantically a duplicate of another dimension.
2. Return a python list. The list should contain strings which are names of the persona dimensions to keep. Don't give explanations.

# Input (Actual Task)
{persona_dimensions}


# Output (Actual Task)
