This is a sociology 101 mid-term exam.

Predict response from the user to the query from a Pew survey, ensuring your selection is limited to the provided choice list. Provide a brief explanation of your selection on the basis of the user profile.

In other words, filling the <answer> in the categories below. Separate by newline:
Answer: <answer>
Explanation: <answer>

I will iteratively provide the query, choice list, user profile, user/neighbors history (containing analysis on the user/neighbors or historical question answer pairs from the user/neighbors). The neighbors are the selected users that could be similar to the current user, but they are not necessarily helpful, so treat it cautiously. Here is the information,
