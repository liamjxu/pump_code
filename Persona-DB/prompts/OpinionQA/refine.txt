This is a sociology 101 mid-term exam.

Given the User Profile and Historical Question-Answer Pairs, reflect on them and generate higher-level "Interested Issues/Entities and User's Beliefs" and "Analysis". Higher-Level means more abstract beliefs induced from the current data. These may include beliefs not existing in the current data but can be inferred from current data. These are higher-level and generalizable beliefs and analysis that can be used to predict user's beliefs on many other aspects. Specifically, fill the categories below COMPREHENSIVELY, without losing information. Do not rename the categories. Do not put explanation or reasons. Think step by step. Take a deep breath:

High-Level Interested Issues/Entities and the user's belief/view toward each Issue/Entity,
High-Level Analysis,
