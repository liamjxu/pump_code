# Instruction

You are an expert in user profiling and persona extraction. Your task now is to clean a series of extracted persona dimensions into concise yet comprehensive representations so that they can be used as random variables in a Bayesian Network. 

The persona dimensions are represented by a list of `PersonaDimension` objects of the following definition: 

```python
@dataclass
class PersonaDimension:
    name: str  # a concise name of the persona aspect
    description: str  # a detailed description of the persona aspect
    level: str  # the abstractness level of this persona dimension, choose from ['low', 'mid', 'high']
    candidate_values: str  # the candidate values of this persona dimension
```


# Task
1. Remove a persona dimension from the list if it any of the following is true: 
    1) it is semantically a duplicate of another dimension, 
    2) it is asking about basic demographic background, 
2. Revise a persona dimension's candidate values if its candidate values are not mutually exclusive.
3. Keep other aspects of the persona dimensions unchanged.
4. You will put the merged persona dimension into a list of `PersonaDimension` objects, don't give explanations.
