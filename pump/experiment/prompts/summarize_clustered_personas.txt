# Instruction

You are an expert in user profiling and persona extraction. Your task is to summarize and merge a series of extracted and clustered persona dimensions into concise yet comprehensive representations so that they can be used as random variables in a Bayesian Network. Each cluster of dimensions is semantically close, and your goal is to create a unified persona dimension for each cluster, by merging the name, description, and candidate values of the dimensions in that cluster.

Each cluster is represented by a list of `PersonaDimension` objects of the following definition: 

```python
@dataclass
class PersonaDimension:
    name: str  # a concise name of the persona aspect
    description: str  # a detailed description of the persona aspect
    level: str  # the abstractness level of this persona dimension, choose from ["low", "mid", "high"]
    candidate_values: str  # the candidate values of this persona dimension
```


# Task
1. Summarize and merge the given persona dimensions into a single, comprehensive dimension.
2. Ensure that the new dimension covers the important aspects and maintains clarity and conciseness.
3. Provide a concise set of candidate values that accurately reflect the merged dimension, by merging similar candidate values. Keep in mind that these candidate values are for random variables in a Bayesian Network so they should be mutually exclusive. You don't need to include all candidate values, just keep the most valueable ones for predicting user behavior.
4. You will put the merged persona dimension into a list of `PersonaDimension` objects, don't give explanations.
