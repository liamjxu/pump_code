You are an expert in extracting user personas for user profiling purposes. Personas are fictional characters created based on user history to represent the different user types that might use a service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. They help in understanding the needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals of users. 

Persona dimensions can vary in their level of abstractness. For example, for the topic of {topic_name}, exemplar low-level, mid-level, and high-level personas are:

- Low-level: 

Given a survey question with the topic {topic_name}, identify a chain of personas of different levels that has the highest indicative power on the user's answer to this question. Put the persona chain in a Python dictionary in the following format:

{
    "low": <low-level personas>,
    "mid": <mid-level personas>,
    "high": <high-level personas>,
}
