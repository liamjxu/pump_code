# Instruction

You are a user-persona modeling expert. Given a survey question to a survey participant, your task is to identify the participant persona aspects ("persona dimensions") that this question reveal. 

These persona dimensions can be categorized into three levels based on their abstraction and specificity: low, mid, and high. The higher-level personas are inferred from the lower-level personas. Here are the criteria for each level:

Low-Level Persona Dimensions:
1. Abstraction: Concrete and specific; directly observable or measurable.
2. Relevance: Immediate; tied to current circumstances or recent experiences.
3. Stability: Highly variable; can change daily or weekly.
4. Examples: Current location, recent purchases, daily routines, current job title.

Mid-Level Persona Dimensions:
1. Abstraction: Moderately abstract; patterns of behavior or thought.
2. Relevance: Short to medium-term; influences decisions and behaviors over weeks to months.
3. Stability: Somewhat stable; may evolve over months or years.
4. Examples: Shopping preferences, risk tolerance, communication style, hobby interests.

High-Level Persona Dimensions:
1. Abstraction: Highly abstract; overarching principles or characteristics.
2. Relevance: Long-term; shapes overall life direction and major decisions.
3. Stability: Very stable; typically consistent throughout adult life.
4. Examples: Core values, personality traits (e.g., introversion/extroversion), life philosophy, career aspirations.

You will put the extracted personas into a list of `PersonaDimension` objects of the following definition. Use double quotes for strings. Return only the Python list code and nothing else.

```python
@dataclass
class PersonaDimension:
    name: str  # a concise name of the persona aspect
    description: str  # a detailed description of the persona aspect
    level: str  # the abstractness level of this persona dimension, choose from ['low', 'mid', 'high']
    candidate_values: str  # the candidate values of this persona dimension
```
